Adminer is a database client image used to easily view and interact with the overall docker stacks database.

When the application is running, go to localhost:8080 then log in with:

System	MySQL
Server	db (inside Docker) or localhost (either works)
Username	root
Password	rootpass
Database	chordatlas

Youâ€™ll see your chords, songs, and song_chords tables right in the browser.
You can browse, edit, run SQL, export/import, etc.
